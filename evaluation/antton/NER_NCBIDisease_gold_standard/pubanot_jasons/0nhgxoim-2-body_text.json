We report the epidemiological , clinical , laboratory , and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients . METHODS : All patients with suspected 2019 - nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan . We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory - confirmed 2019 - nCoV infection by real - time RT - PCR and next - generation sequencing . Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records . Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data . Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) and those who had not . FINDINGS : By Jan 2 , 2020 , 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory - confirmed 2019 - nCoV infection . Most of the infected patients were men ( 30 [ 73 % ] of 41 ) ; less than half had underlying diseases ( 13 [ 32 % ] ) , including diabetes ( eight [ 20 % ] ) , hypertension ( six [ 15 % ] ) , and cardiovascular disease ( six [ 15 % ] ) . Median age was 49 \u00b7 0 years ( IQR 41 \u00b7 0 - 58 \u00b7 0 ) . 27 ( 66 % ) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market . One family cluster was found . Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever ( 40 [ 98 % ] of 41 patients ) , cough ( 31 [ 76 % ] ) , and myalgia or fatigue ( 18 [ 44 % ] ) ; less common symptoms were sputum production ( 11 [ 28 % ] of 39 ) , headache ( three [ 8 % ] of 38 ) , haemoptysis ( two [ 5 % ] of 39 ) , and diarrhoea ( one [ 3 % ] of 38 ) . Dyspnoea developed in 22 ( 55 % ) of 40 patients ( median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8 \u00b7 0 days [ IQR 5 \u00b7 0 - 13 \u00b7 0 ] ) pathogen coronavirus . Lopinavir / Ritonavir , Nucleoside analogues , Neuraminidase inhibitors , Remdesivir , peptide ( EK1 ) , arbidol , RNA synthesis inhibitors ( such as TDF , 3TC ) , anti - inflammatory drugs ( such as hormones and other molecules ) , Chinese traditional medicine , such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule , could be the drug treatment options for 2019 - nCoV . However , the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019 - nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 33, "end": 52}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 112, "end": 135}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 137, "end": 149}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 298, "end": 306}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 336, "end": 348}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 483, "end": 505}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 659, "end": 707}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 1109, "end": 1131}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 1263, "end": 1272}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 1293, "end": 1306}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 1329, "end": 1352}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 12, "span": {"begin": 1425, "end": 1435}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 13, "span": {"begin": 1437, "end": 1452}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 14, "span": {"begin": 1568, "end": 1574}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 15, "span": {"begin": 1576, "end": 1584}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 16, "span": {"begin": 1607, "end": 1613}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 17, "span": {"begin": 1635, "end": 1643}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 18, "span": {"begin": 1646, "end": 1654}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 19, "span": {"begin": 1698, "end": 1705}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 20, "span": {"begin": 1740, "end": 1749}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 21, "span": {"begin": 1775, "end": 1787}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 22, "span": {"begin": 1815, "end": 1825}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 23, "span": {"begin": 1849, "end": 1858}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 24, "span": {"begin": 1934, "end": 1943}, "obj": "ne"}]}
