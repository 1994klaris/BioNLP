Despite intense research efforts , how , when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty . A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan , Hubei province , China . As of 25 January 2020 , at least 1 , 975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019 . Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan . Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever , dizziness and a cough . Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae , which is designated here ' WH - Human 1 ' coronavirus ( and has also been referred to as ' 2019 - nCoV ' ) . Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome ( 29 , 903 nucleotides ) revealed that the virus was most closely related ( 89 . 1 % nucleotide similarity ) to a group of SARS - like coronaviruses ( genus Betacoronavirus , subgenus Sarbecovirus ) that had previously been found in bats in China5 . This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill - over from animals to cause severe disease in humans . \u00b7 0 years ( IQR 41 \u00b7 0 - 58 \u00b7 0 ) . 27 ( 66 % ) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market . One family cluster was found . Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever ( 40 [ 98 % ] of 41 patients ) , cough ( 31 [ 76 % ] ) , and myalgia or fatigue ( 18 [ 44 % ] ) ; less common symptoms were sputum production ( 11 [ 28 % ] of 39 ) , headache ( three [ 8 % ] of 38 ) , haemoptysis ( two [ 5 % ] of 39 ) , and diarrhoea ( one [ 3 % ] of 38 ) . Dyspnoea developed in 22 ( 55 % ) of 40 patients ( median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8 \u00b7 0 days [ IQR 5 \u00b7 0 - 13 \u00b7 0 ] ) . 26 ( 63 % ) of 41 patients had lymphopenia . All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT . Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome ( 12 [ 29 % ] ) , RNAaemia ( six [ 15 % ] ) , acute cardiac injury ( five [ 12 % ] ) and secondary infection ( four [ 10 % ] ) . 13 ( 32 % ) patients were admitted to an ICU and six ( 15 % ) died . Compared with non - ICU patients , ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2 , IL7 , IL10 , GSCF , IP10 , MCP1 , MIP1A , and TNF\u03b1 . INTERPRETATION : The 2019 - nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality . Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin , epidemiology , duration of human transmission , and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies .
