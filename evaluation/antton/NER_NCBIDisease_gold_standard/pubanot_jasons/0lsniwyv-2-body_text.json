Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man , with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days . Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases , but also inflammation , high fever , cough , acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death . Coronavirus infection ( regardless of the various types of corona virus ) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells ( MCs ) , which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms . Virus activate MCs which release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease ; while late activation provokes the generation of pro - inflammatory IL - 1 family members including IL - 1 and IL - 33 . Here , we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti - inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL - 1 family members .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 30, "end": 51}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 134, "end": 146}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 273}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 319, "end": 340}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 351, "end": 364}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 366, "end": 377}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 7, "span": {"begin": 379, "end": 385}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 8, "span": {"begin": 387, "end": 421}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 9, "span": {"begin": 425, "end": 456}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 10, "span": {"begin": 481, "end": 503}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 11, "span": {"begin": 540, "end": 553}, "obj": "ne"}]}
