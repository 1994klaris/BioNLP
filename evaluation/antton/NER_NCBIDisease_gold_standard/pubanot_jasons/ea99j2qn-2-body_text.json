We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market . The two patients shared common clinical features including fever , cough , and multiple ground - glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration . Here , we highlight the use of a low - input metagenomic next - generation sequencing ( mNGS ) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) . It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus ( named 2019 - nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement ) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level ( 1 . 5 % and 0 . 62 % of total RNA sequenced ) . The entire viral genome is 29 , 881 O nt in length ( GenBank MN988668 and MN988669 , Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736 ) and is classified into \u03b2 - coronavirus genus . Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019 - nCoV is close to coronaviruses ( CoVs ) circulating in Rhinolophus ( Horseshoe bats ) , such as 98 . 7 % nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV / 4991 ( GenBank KP876546 , 370 O nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence ) and 87 . 9 % nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat - SL - CoVZC45 and bat - SL - CoVZXC21 . Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a / 1b , S , and N genes also suggests 2019 - nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans .
