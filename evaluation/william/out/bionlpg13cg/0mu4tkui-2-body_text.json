   "text": "Virus infections are a continuous threat to the human population; e.g. HIV, hepatitis viruses, and influenza viruses constitute a large proportion of morbidity and mortality each year. Apart from infection with well-described viruses, outbreaks with previously undescribed viruses occur regularly (e.g. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Furthermore, respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea in young children or immunocompromised persons often test negative for known viruses, and could very well be caused by yet unknown pathogens.",
