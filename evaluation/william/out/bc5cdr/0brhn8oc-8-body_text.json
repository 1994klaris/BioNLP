  "text": "The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) frameshift-inducing pseudoknot was the fi rst structure of a frameshift-inducing pseudoknot ( Figure 2D ) [6] . The MMTV pseudoknot forms a compact structure of two guanine/cytosine-rich A-form helices. The MMTV pseudoknot has a bend of approximately 60ยบ between the two helices, caused by an unpaired adenine that intercalates between the helices and may act as a hinge. Subsequent structural and functional studies of several variants of the MMTV pseudoknot reveal that the intercalated nucleotide and the resulting bend between stems 1 and 2 are required for effi cient frameshifting [28] .",
