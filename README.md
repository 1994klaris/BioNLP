## Bioinformatics databases (can be used to build dictionaries)
UniprotKB  

To create a dictionary of gene/protein names (contains protein and gene names including synonyms)  

https://www.uniprot.org/

PubChem

To create a dictionary of chemicals/drugs (contains small molecules, but also larger molecules such as nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and chemically-modified macromolecules) 

https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

Disease Ontology  

http://disease-ontology.org/

Gene Ontology  

Database with known function of genes

Drugbank

www.drugbank.ca

Database with drugs and known protein targets (including references for the interaction)

OMIM  

Database with human diseases and known genes

 
KEGG
Database with known protein signalling pathways


## Corpora for training and validation  
GeneTag  
To evaluate the dictionary approach as well as train a model for annotating proteins; also available in BioC format and updated version GeneTag-05
