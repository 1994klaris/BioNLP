BioNLP
=======
Repository for student projects within biomedical text mining from Lund University.


# Resources
## 1. NLP Python packages  
scispaCy  
scispaCy is a Python package containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text  
https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/


## 2. Resources for dictionaries  
UniprotKB  
To create a dictionary of gene/protein names (contains protein and gene names including synonyms)  
https://www.uniprot.org/

PubChem
To create a dictionary of chemicals/drugs (contains small molecules, but also larger molecules such as nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and chemically-modified macromolecules)  
https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

Disease Ontology  
http://disease-ontology.org/


## 3. Corpora for training and validation  
GeneTag  
To evaluate the dictionary approach as well as train a model for annotating proteins; also available in BioC format and updated version GeneTag-05  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15960837

Corpora in BioC format
