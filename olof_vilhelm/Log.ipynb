    "1. Use Genia parser to generate Part-Of-Speech tags for all words in the abstracts.\n",

    "1. Use dependency graph to find the relationships.\n",
    "    - Not sure how to do this yet, but we believe this should be possible. We think the head of the relevant sentences will be _\"inhibits\"_ or similar, and then the inhibitor and inhibitee will be directly related to it in the depency graph. \n",
