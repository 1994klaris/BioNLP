SONJA EDIT:
After sending the '[?FP] - Possible miss in bioinfer' predictions to Sonja Aits, she confirmed/denied our predicted relations, as well as noting other relations that were missed in the Bioinfer corpus. Confirmed predictions are tagged as [STP], denied are tagged as [SFP], new True relations are tagged as [S].

Keywords with nsubj found:	118

(15) New True Relations, added by Sonja [S]
	The new relations are individually tagged with these ID's, along with an [S] tag.

EVALUATION:

	ORIGINAL DISMISSIVE INTERPRETATION:
		Remove all Sonja edits and data containing ?FP.
		Remove 12+1 TP, 1 FP and 15+50 T relations.

		14 TP, 32 FP, 2708 FN, 2722 True relations.

		Precision:	0.304347826
		Recall:		0.005143277
		F1-score:	0.010115606

	REVISED DISMISSIVE INTERPRETATION:
		Remove all data containing ?FP: Remove 5 T relations.

		27 TP, 33 FP, 2755 FN, 2782 True relations.

		Precision:	0.45
		Recall:		0.009705248
		F1-score:	0.019000704

	REVISED PESSIMIST INTERPRETATION:
		Interpret ?FP as FP: Add 6 to FP relations.
