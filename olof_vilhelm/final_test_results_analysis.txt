CALCULATION METHODS:

	Precision:	(TP) / (TP + FP)
	Recall:		(TP) / (TP + FN)
	F1-score:	2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)

RESULTS:

	PESSIMIST INTERPRETATION:
		Interpret ?FP as FP:
		Add 20 to FP relations.
		15 TP, 51 FP, 2757 FN, 2772 True relations
		
		Precision:	0.227272727
		Recall:		0.005411255
		F1-score:	0.010570823

	OPTIMIST INTERPRETATION:
		Interpret all ?FP as TP
		Add 22 relations to TP and 19 True relations (See note on datum with id 759).

		37 TP, 31 FP, 2754 FN, 2791 True relations.

		Precision:	0.544117647
		Recall:		0.013256897
		F1-score:	0.025883175

	DISMISSIVE INTERPRETATION:
		Remove all datum containing ?FP.
		Remove 1 TP and 50 T relations.

		14 TP, 31 FP, 2708 FN, 2722 True relations.

		Precision:	0.311111111
		Recall:		0.005143277
		F1-score:	0.010119262

	DISMISSIVE SLIGHT-OPTIMIST INTERPRETATION
		Interpret category 'Relation probably should've been included in test set' as TP.
		Add those 14 to True relations. Remove datum from other ?FP categories.

		29 TP, 31 FP, 2708 FN, 2781 True relations.

		Precision:	0.483333333
		Recall:		0.010427903
		F1-score:	0.020415345
